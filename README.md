It happens more often than I would like, but when I solve certain issue/problem/stuff with a tailored solution that needed a lot of research I do not memorize the steps for doing this thing, where to look for that concept, or event the basic. I will try to do my best and store here a set of scripts for my future me.  

# keep-n-from-N
To launch the script: `./exec.sh N n`. Creates N random files -named after the pattern db-NNNNN.dump-, write the list of created files before deleting the first N-n ones and after the deletion.
